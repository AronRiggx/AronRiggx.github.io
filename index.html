                <p class="columnText">
                    Beginning in the early 17th century Warsaw records associate a sword-wielding
                    mermaid with the city. Since 1622, the Warsaw arms have been rendered as a mermaid with sword and
                    shield in hand, representing Melusina from the River Vistula (Wisła), who in legend led Duke
                    Bolesław II of Masovia (1262–1313) to the appropriate site (a fishing village) and ordered him to
                    found the city, in about 1294. The origin of the legendary figure is not fully known. The city's
                    motto is, appropriately, Contemnit procellas ("It defies the storms").
                <p class="columnText"></p>
                The current official design of the symbol was introduced in 1938 but it was only used in this form
                until the beginning of World War II. After 1945, Communist authorities changed the emblem by
                removing the crown. The insignia was restored to the pre-war form on August 15, 1990.

                In addition there is a "Great Emblem of the Capital City of Warsaw" (Herb Wielki Miasta Stołecznego
                Warszawy) used only for ceremonial occasions. It includes a depiction of the Virtuti Militari medal,
                which was awarded to the City to honor the bravery of its citizens during World War II. It also adds
                the second motto to the emblem — Semper invicta (Always invincible).

                Every member of the Queen's Royal Hussars of the United Kingdom light cavalry wears the Maid of
                Warsaw, the crest of the City of Warsaw, on the left sleeve of his No. 2 (Service) Dress. Members
                of 651 Squadron Army Air Corps of the United Kingdom also wear the Maid of Warsaw on the left sleeve
                of their No. 2 (Service) Dress.</p>
                <p class="columnText">
                    The first coat of arms of Warsaw depicted a dragon with a male human head, carrying a sword and a
                    shield. The first known usage was on a seal from 1390. This is the oldest existing armed seal of
                    Warsaw, consisting of a round seal bordered with the Latin inscription Sigilium Civitatis
                    Varsoviensis (Seal of the city of Warsaw).[2] Gradually the male head and body was replaced with
                    that of a female, and by the end of 16th century the tail was also changed from that of a dragon to
                    that of a fish. The only remaining parts of the original coat of arms are the sword and shield.

        <h2>A brief history of Warsaw:</h2>
        <h4>Warsaw, the capital city of Poland, is a vibrant metropolis with a rich history and a dynamic blend of
            tradition and modernity. Situated on the Vistula River, it is the country’s largest city and a hub of
            political, cultural, and economic activity. Known for its resilience, Warsaw has been rebuilt from the
            ashes after the devastation of World War II, particularly in its meticulously reconstructed Old Town, a
            UNESCO World Heritage site. The city’s landscape combines historic architecture, such as the Royal
            Castle and Wilanów Palace, with contemporary skyscrapers and bustling business districts. Home to
            numerous museums, theaters, and universities, Warsaw offers a unique mix of intellectual and creative
            energy. The city is also known for its green spaces, such as the sprawling Łazienki Park, providing a
            serene escape from its urban core.
        
        Warsaw is a city of contrasts, where the past and present coexist harmoniously. The city’s history stretches back over 700 years, but it’s perhaps best known for its remarkable rebirth after World War II, when 85% of the city was destroyed. Today, Warsaw is a symbol of resilience, with its Old Town beautifully restored, reflecting its historical charm. In contrast, the modern cityscape is marked by sleek glass towers, symbolizing Poland’s rapid development and integration into the global economy.
        Culturally, Warsaw is a dynamic center for music, arts, and academia. It is the birthplace of renowned composer Frédéric Chopin, whose legacy is celebrated through concerts and festivals. 
        The city is also home to world-class museums like the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews and the Warsaw Uprising Museum, offering profound insights into its storied past. 
        With a flourishing food scene, Warsaw combines traditional Polish cuisine with a growing influence of international flavors, making it a culinary destination as well.
        Its extensive public transportation system, vibrant nightlife, and rich cultural calendar make Warsaw a city that appeals to both tourists and locals alike.</h4>
